Project Description:

FoodHub is a web application platform that store people opinions/reviews on various food items. The application allows users to scan a food product's barcode and if the item being scanned is already in the database, then the previous reviews will be displayed. The reviews will consist of a star rating along with a word comment. The user can gain quick insight about the product scanned by seeing other people's opinion along with a simple nutrition breakdown that will be show to the user as well. If the product scanned has not been reviewed before, the user will have the option to create a review for the item and leave their thoughts about it for other to see in the future.
